Three Steps for HEAP

1. Insertion and Deletion in a Heap 'heapInsertionDeletion.js'
   Considered a heap , then adding and deleting the element maintaining the heap structure
   Heap Structure could be a max-heap or min-heap

2. Heap Construction './heapConstruction.js'
   You construct either max or min heap,using the Insertion function 
   This is called heapify, and there are two ways in which you can do it the difference is in complexities.

3. Heap Sort './heapSort.js'
   First build a heap then using the Deletion fuction you can sort the elements
