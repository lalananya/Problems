Binary Search Tree

1. When a tree has atmost two children - BST
2. There are two ways insertion in BST is implemented class-based (./bst-c.js) and function-based (./bst-f.js)
3. We can traverse the tree in three ways InOrder, preOrder, postOrder
   In these orders, we are actually trying to reach a root or a leaf and we are printing the value once we reach either of two.
